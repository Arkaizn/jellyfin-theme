# My Jellyfin Configuration

This repository contains my personal CSS files and theme modules for **Jellyfin**. I use these files to customize the interface, improve the layout, and add specific visual tweaks to my media server.

## Features
- **Custom CSS Layouts**: Optimized for desktop and mobile views.
- **Modular Design**: Separate CSS files for specific UI elements like the sidebar, progress bars, and logo.
- **Visual Improvements**: Added blur effects, rounded corners, and cleaner button placements.

### Original Theme
The core of this configuration is based on the **Jamfin** theme created by [JamsRepos](https://github.com/JamsRepos/Jamfin).

I have modified the code to better suit my personal preferences and to fix specific layout issues.
